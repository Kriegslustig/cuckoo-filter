# Cuckoo Filter

A ("pure") JavaScript (actually TypeScript) implementation of [Cuckoo Filters](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf).

I don't know of any legitimate use-cases for this. If you want to run Cuckoo Filters using node.js use (or write) a wrapper for [cfilter](https://github.com/irfansharif/cfilter) (written in Go) instead, since it's much faster. So this project is mainly educational.
